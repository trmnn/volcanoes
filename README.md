This project creates an interactive html map with marked locations of Volcanoes in Iceland.
It uses data available from Iceland Met Office which includes locations, height and names 
of all active and dormant volcanoes. 
I use pandas package to get the relevant data from file and folium package to draw the map
and markers to my specifications.
